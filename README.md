ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!<br />
<br />
My name is @aerulion,<br />
<br />
Iâ€™m 21 years old and an java developer from Germany.<br />
<br />
I love working with Java and SQL, and Iâ€™m very interested in Minecraft / Spigot plugin development.<br />
Iâ€™m currently a developer at a small German Minecraft server called Minecraft-Corp. My main project is the development of a custom item system which introduces many new gameplay elements to the game, as well as an advanced storage system to keep up with large amounts of items.<br />
